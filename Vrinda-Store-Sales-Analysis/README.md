## What I Did in This Project
This project follows a structured approach to sales data analysis, focusing on exploration, visualization, and MIS reporting. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the steps:

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

- Identified key variables such as sales amount, order count, gender, age group, state, and sales channel.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Removed any duplicate entries and ensured consistency in data (e.g., state names, channel labels).
- Handled missing values where applicable to prepare the data for analysis.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Created a line chart for "Orders Vs Sales" to track monthly trends for management reporting.
- Generated pie charts for "Sales: Men Vs Women," "Order Status," "Orders: Age Vs Gender," and "Orders Channels" to visualize distributions.
- Used bar charts to highlight the top 5 states by sales.

### 4. Reporting
- Compiled key insights and a final recommendation into `Annual-Report-Insights.docx` based on the visualizations for strategic decision-making.
