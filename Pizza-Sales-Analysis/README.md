# Pizza Sales Analysis (SQL) üçïüìä

## Project Overview
This project analyzes 12 months of pizza sales data using **MySQL** to provide actionable insights for optimizing menu offerings, pricing strategies, and inventory management. By integrating data from multiple tables, I developed a series of SQL queries to answer business questions ranging from basic to advanced, covering total orders, revenue, customer preferences, and temporal trends.

This project showcases my skills in **SQL query writing**, **data analysis**, and **database management**, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio for roles in data analytics, business intelligence, or database administration.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of four CSV files, representing pizza sales data over 12 months in 2015:

- **orders.csv**: Contains order information.
  - Columns: `order_id`, `date`, `time`.
  - Sample Data: 21,380 orders (e.g., order ID 1, date 1/1/2015, time 11:38:36).
- **order_details.csv**: Contains detailed order information.
  - Columns: `order_details_id`, `order_id`, `pizza_id`, `quantity`.
  - Sample Data: 21 rows shown (e.g., order ID 1, pizza ID `hawaiian_m`, quantity 1).
- **pizza_types.csv**: Defines pizza types and categories.
  - Columns: `pizza_type_id`, `name`, `category`, `ingredients`.
  - Categories: Chicken, Classic, Supreme, Veggie.
  - Sample Data: 32 pizza types (e.g., `bbq_ckn`, "The Barbecue Chicken Pizza", category "Chicken").
- **pizzas.csv**: Contains pizza details with sizes and prices.
  - Columns: `pizza_id`, `pizza_type_id`, `size`, `price`.
  - Sizes: S, M, L, XL, XXL.
  - Prices: Range from $12 to $35.95.
  - Sample Data: 96 rows (e.g., `bbq_ckn_s`, type `bbq_ckn`, size S, price 12.75).

### Data Insights
- The dataset includes 21,380 orders across 32 pizza types, categorized into Chicken, Classic, Supreme, and Veggie.
- Each order can include multiple pizzas, with quantities tracked in `order_details.csv`.
- The data spans all of 2015, allowing for temporal analysis (e.g., by hour, day, or cumulative trends).

## Tools and Technologies
- **MySQL**: Used for database creation, data import, and query execution.
- **CSV Files**: The raw data files (`orders.csv`, `order_details.csv`, `pizza_types.csv`, `pizzas.csv`) were imported into MySQL tables.

## What I Did in This Project
This project follows a structured approach to analyzing pizza sales data using SQL. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of the steps:

### 1. Database Setup
- Created a MySQL database named `pizza_sales`.
- Imported the four CSV files (`orders.csv`, `order_details.csv`, `pizza_types.csv`, `pizzas.csv`) into corresponding tables using MySQL Workbench or a similar tool.
- Verified the data integrity by checking for missing or inconsistent values (e.g., ensuring foreign key relationships between tables).

### 2. Data Exploration
- Explored the tables to understand their structure and relationships:
  - `orders` and `order_details` are linked via `order_id`.
  - `order_details` and `pizzas` are linked via `pizza_id`.
  - `pizzas` and `pizza_types` are linked via `pizza_type_id`.
- Confirmed the dataset was clean and ready for analysis (no major cleaning required).

### 3. SQL Query Development
- Developed 13 SQL queries to answer business questions, categorized into Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced levels:
  - **Basic Queries**:
    1. Total number of orders placed.
    2. Total revenue from pizza sales.
    3. Highest-priced pizza.
    4. Most common pizza size ordered.
    5. Top 5 most ordered pizza types by quantity.
  - **Intermediate Queries**:
    6. Total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
    7. Distribution of orders by hour of the day.
    8. Category-wise distribution of pizza types.
    9. Average number of pizzas ordered per day.
    10. Top 3 pizza types by revenue.
  - **Advanced Queries**:
    11. Percentage contribution of each pizza category to total revenue.
    12. Cumulative revenue over time.
    13. Top 3 pizza types by revenue for each category.
- Used SQL features like `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `SUM`, `COUNT`, `ROUND`, subqueries, window functions (`RANK`, `OVER`), and more.

### 4. Insights Generation
- Analyzed the query results to identify trends and patterns in pizza sales.
- Documented the findings in a presentation (`Pizza Sales SQL Project.pdf`) for easy reference.

### Key Output
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales through SQL queries, with results that can inform business decisions. The queries are stored in the `sql/` folder as `query1.sql` to `query13.sql`, and the detailed results are presented in `docs/Pizza Sales SQL Project.pdf`.
