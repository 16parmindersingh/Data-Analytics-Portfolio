# HR Analytics Dashboard ðŸ“ŠðŸ‘¥

## Project Overview
This project involves creating an **HR Analytics Dashboard** using **Power BI** to analyze employee data and generate MIS reports for strategic HR management. The dashboard focuses on key HR metrics such as **attrition rates**, **employee demographics**, and **job role performance**, serving as a decision-support tool to identify factors contributing to employee turnover and enhance retention strategies.

This project showcases my skills in **data visualization**, **management reporting**, and **dashboard creation** using Power BI. Itâ€™s a practical example of how I can transform raw HR data into actionable insights for management-ready HR systems.

## Dataset Description
The dataset, `HR_Analytics.csv`, contains employee records for HR analytics. It includes 1470 rows and 35 columns, with the following key columns:

- **EmpID**: Unique identifier for each employee.
- **Age**: Age of the employee (e.g., 18 to 60).
- **AgeGroup**: Age group of the employee (e.g., 18-25, 26-35).
- **Attrition**: Whether the employee left the company (Yes/No).
- **Department**: Employeeâ€™s department (e.g., Sales, Research & Development, Human Resources).
- **JobRole**: Employeeâ€™s role (e.g., Sales Executive, Research Scientist, Laboratory Technician).
- **Gender**: Employeeâ€™s gender (Male/Female).
- **EducationField**: Field of education (e.g., Life Sciences, Medical, Human Resources).
- **MonthlyIncome**: Employeeâ€™s monthly income (in USD).
- **YearsAtCompany**: Number of years the employee has been with the company.
- **TotalWorkingYears**: Total years of work experience.
- **MaritalStatus**: Marital status (Single, Married, Divorced).
- **OverTime**: Whether the employee works overtime (Yes/No).

### Data Insights
- The dataset includes 1470 employee records across various departments and job roles.
- It contains no missing values, making it ready for analysis in Power BI.
- Key metrics like `Attrition`, `MonthlyIncome`, and `YearsAtCompany` provide a foundation for understanding employee retention and satisfaction.
- The dashboard shows 1416 employees after filtering, with 229 employees leaving (attrition).

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: Used for data loading, transformation, and creating the interactive dashboard.
- **CSV**: The dataset (`HR_Analytics.csv`) was imported into Power BI for analysis.

## What I Did in This Project
This project follows a structured approach to building an HR analytics dashboard in Power BI for MIS purposes. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the steps:

### 1. Data Loading
- Imported the `HR_Analytics.csv` file into Power BI using the "Get Data" feature.
- Verified the data structure, ensuring all 35 columns and 1470 rows were loaded correctly.

### 2. Data Transformation
- Used Power BIâ€™s **Power Query Editor** to review the dataset for consistency.
- Confirmed there were no missing values, so no major cleaning was required.
- Renamed columns and adjusted data types (e.g., ensuring `MonthlyIncome` was numeric) for better usability in visualizations.
- Applied filters to focus on 1416 employees for the dashboard (possibly excluding certain records).

### 3. Dashboard Design
- Created a single-page dashboard in Power BI with a focus on HR metrics for management reporting.
- Added **slicers** for `Department`, `Job Role`, `Gender`, and `Age Group` to enable interactive filtering.
- Designed the following visualizations:
  - **Key Metrics Cards**: Displayed overall employees (1416), attrition (229), attrition rate (16.2%), average age (37 years), average salary ($6.5K), and average years at company (7.0 years).
  - **Attrition by Education (Pie Chart)**: Showed the distribution of attrition across education fields.
  - **Attrition by Age (Bar Chart)**: Highlighted attrition counts by age group.
  - **Attrition by Salary Slab (Bar Chart)**: Displayed attrition across salary ranges.
  - **Attrition by Years at Company (Line Chart)**: Illustrated attrition trends over years of tenure.
  - **Attrition by Job Role (Bar Chart)**: Showed attrition counts by job role.
  - **Attrition by Gender (Bar Chart)**: Displayed the gender breakdown of employees who left.

### 4. Insights Generation
- Analyzed the visualizations to identify patterns in employee attrition for management decision-making.
- Used Power BIâ€™s interactive features (e.g., slicers) to drill down into specific departments, roles, and demographics.

### Key Output
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of HR metrics, with interactive visualizations that allow management to explore attrition trends and employee demographics dynamically. Below is a screenshot of the dashboard:

## Results and Insights
- **Attrition Rate**: 16.2% of employees (229 out of 1416) left the company.
- **Demographic Trends**:
  - Employees aged **26-35** have the highest attrition (111 employees), followed by the 18-25 age group (43).
  - **63%** of employees who left are male (138), and **37%** are female (78).
  - Employees with education in **Life Sciences** (38%) and **Medical** (25%) fields have the highest attrition rates.
- **Salary Impact**: The majority of attrition occurs in the **â‰¤5K salary slab** (158 employees), indicating that lower-paid employees are more likely to leave.
- **Job Role Analysis**: **Laboratory Technicians** (80) and **Sales Executives** (56) have the highest attrition, while **Research Directors** (2) and **Managers** (5) have the lowest.
- **Tenure Trends**: Attrition peaks at **1 year** of tenure (57 employees), with notable spikes at 2 years (20), 5 years (20), and 10 years (15).
- **Management Recommendations**: Suggests focusing HR policies on salary adjustments for lower-paid roles and retention programs for Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives.
