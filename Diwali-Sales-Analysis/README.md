# Diwali Sales Data Analysis ðŸŽ‡ðŸ“ˆ

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from Diwali, a major Indian festival, to identify the most popular products based on order volume. Using **Python**, I performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization to generate MIS reports and uncover insights. The goal was to provide management with actionable data for strategic decision-making during the festive season, laying a foundation for enhanced business reporting systems.

This project showcases my skills in **data cleaning**, **data manipulation**, and **data visualization** using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. Itâ€™s a great example of how I can work with real-world datasets to deliver management-ready insights.

## Dataset Description
The dataset, `Diwali Sales Data.csv`, contains sales records from the Diwali season. It includes 11251 transactions with the following columns:

- **User_ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Cust_name**: Name of the customer.
- **Product_ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Gender**: Customer gender (F/M).
- **Age Group**: Age group of the customer (e.g., 26-35, 0-17, 55+).
- **Age**: Exact age of the customer.
- **Marital_Status**: 0 (unmarried) or 1 (married).
- **State**: Customer's state in India (e.g., Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh).
- **Zone**: Region in India (e.g., Western, Southern, Central).
- **Occupation**: Customer's occupation (e.g., Healthcare, Govt, IT Sector).
- **Product_Category**: Category of the product (e.g., Auto, Food, Clothing).
- **Orders**: Number of orders placed for the product.
- **Amount**: Total amount spent on the purchase.

### Data Insights
- The dataset initially had 11251 rows and 15 columns.
- Two columns, `Status` and `unnamed1`, were empty and removed during cleaning.
- The `Amount` column had 12 missing values, which were dropped, leaving 11239 rows for analysis.
- The data includes diverse customer demographics and geographic information, making it suitable for broader MIS reporting in the future.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for creating visualizations (bar chart).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for writing and running the code (`Diwali Sales Analysis.ipynb`).

## What I Did in This Project
This project follows a structured approach to data analysis, focusing on cleaning and visualizing the data for MIS purposes. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the steps:

### 1. Data Loading
- Loaded the `Diwali Sales Data.csv` file into a Pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()` with `unicode_escape` encoding to handle special characters.
- Checked the dataset's structure using `df.shape` (11251 rows, 15 columns) and `df.head(10)` to preview the first 10 rows.

### 2. Data Exploration
- Used `df.info()` to understand the data types and identify missing values.
- Found that the `Amount` column was a float, while `Status` and `unnamed1` were completely empty.

### 3. Data Cleaning
- **Dropped Unnecessary Columns**: Removed the `Status` and `unnamed1` columns using `df.drop()` since they had no data.
- **Handled Missing Values**: Identified 12 missing values in the `Amount` column using `pd.isnull(df).sum()`. Dropped these rows with `df.dropna()`, reducing the dataset to 11239 rows.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converted the `Amount` column from float to integer using `df['Amount'].astype('int')` for consistency in analysis.

### 4. Data Visualization
- Created a bar chart to visualize the top 10 products by total orders for management reporting.
- Used `df.groupby('Product_ID')['Orders'].sum().nlargest(10)` to calculate the total orders for each product and select the top 10.
- Plotted the results using Matplotlib with `plot(kind='bar')`, setting the figure size to 12x7 for better readability.

### Key Output
The bar chart highlights the 10 products with the highest number of orders, providing a clear view for management to prioritize inventory and marketing strategies during Diwali sales.

## Results and Insights
- **Top Products**: The bar chart shows the top 10 products by order volume, offering management insights into high-demand items during Diwali.
- **Data Quality**: After cleaning, the dataset is reliable for MIS reporting, with no missing values and consistent data types.
- **Potential for Further Analysis**: The dataset includes customer demographics (age, gender, occupation) and geographic data (state, zone), which could be integrated into advanced MIS systems for deeper purchasing pattern analysis.

## Skills Demonstrated
This project highlights my ability to:
- Work with real-world datasets and handle common data issues like missing values.
- Use Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib) for data analysis and visualization tailored for management reporting.
- Present findings in a clear and visual format to support decision-making.
- Write clean, documented code in a Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility.

## Why This Project Matters
For recruiters, this project demonstrates my foundational skills in data analysis using Python, which are valuable for roles in MIS, business intelligence, or management reporting. For others, it provides a clear example of how to perform data cleaning and visualization on a sales dataset, with applications in retail, e-commerce, or strategic business systems.
